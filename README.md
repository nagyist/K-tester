A demo Maven web app that allows the user to submit API calls to Kontomatik Service (by default calls are addressed to the Test API endpoint) and view the result XML responses. 
The app displays the SignIn Widget enabling users to sign into banks, and then exposes through a simple web interface all the commands and HTTP parameters required for interacting with the service.  
Users can also change the 'client' and 'apiKey' parameter.
