## Kontomatik app

- A **demo** Maven web app that allows users to run [Kontomatik Service](http://developer.kontomatik.com/api-doc) commands and view the result XML responses. Calls are addressed by default to the Test API endpoint. 

- The app displays the SignIn Widget enabling users to sign into banks, and then exposes through a simple JSF web interface all the commands and HTTP parameters required for interacting with the service. 

- Users can also change the 'client' and 'apiKey' parameter.
