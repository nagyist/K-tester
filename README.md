## K-tester

- A Maven web app that allows the user to run [Kontomatik API (web service)](http://developer.kontomatik.com/api-doc) commands and view the result XML responses 

- The home page embeds the Sign-in Widget enabling the user to connect to his bank; to login with test credentials, select Polish bank BGZ (eBGZ) then enter username = 'test' and password = 'Test123'

- After successfully signing in, you will be redirected to a page displaying a GUI panel where the main Kontomatik API [commands and parameters](http://developer.kontomatik.com/api-doc/#advanced-api) are mapped to HTML user input components 

- It's also possible to replace the default client credentials used internally by the app with any valid client name/API key
